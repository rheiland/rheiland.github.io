<h1>ParaView</h1>
<a href=http://paraview.org>ParaView</a> is an open source [parallel] visualization application
from Kitware that I have used for many different projects. It offers a quick way to visualize scientific
datasets. I also played a small role in helping extend it to perform information visualization, primarily
to visualize [large] graphs using the Parallel Boost Graph library (now part of <a href=http://www.boost.org/>Boost</a> proper).
