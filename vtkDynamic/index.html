<h1>Dynamic VTK Tests</h1>
This was a test of VTK's ability to dynamically draw data, inspired by Joseph Cottam (who supplied the
Peano-like path alg for the dots).  Joseph's Stencil code was much more elegant than the equivalent Python
code in the scripts below.

Sample VTK-Python scripts (to run these you will need a Python-wrapped VTK installation):
<p>
<li><a href=drawPerDot.py>drawPerDot.py</a> - updates the rendering after each dot is added
<li><a href=drawPerShell.py>drawPerShell.py</a> - updates the rendering after an entire shell is added
To summarize, these scripts use the .Modified() method of a VTK object to tell the pipeline that things
have changed.  Also, the range of the scalar data for the Mapper needs to be dynamically updated
(glyphsMapper.SetScalarRange(0,npts)).

Sample drawing times:

heiland@Macintosh-7:~/Documents/Lumsdaine/Joseph$ time python drawPerDot.py 40
maxShell = 40
npts =  1599

real	0m29.210s
user	0m16.924s
sys	0m2.670s
heiland@Macintosh-7:~/Documents/Lumsdaine/Joseph$ time python drawPerShell.py 40
maxShell = 40
npts =  1599

real	0m1.064s
user	0m0.518s
