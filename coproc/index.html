<h1>Coprocessing</h1>
<p>
While at NCSA, I performed an informal evaluation of some HPC coprocessing systems that were available
at the time. Coprocessing (or <i>in-situ</i>) systems allow real-time visualization of a running simulation 
(as opposed to doing post-processing). This was funded through a DoD HPC 
Modernization Program contract and was joint work with Mary Wheeler and Clint Dawson (both at UT
Austin) and others. Their PCE-QUAL-ICM was a parallelized model used to perform
simulation studies of the water quality of the Chesapeake Bay.

Today, one should consider looking at <a href=http://catalyst.paraview.org/>Catalyst</a>,
<a href=https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/>VisIt</a> and other tools for similar open source 
visualization functionality.
