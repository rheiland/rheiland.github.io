<h1>IDock - Immersive Molecular Docker</h1>
While working at NCSA, I worked on an interesting molecular docking application.
The PI for the project was <a href=http://www.af.mil/AboutUs/Biographies/Display/tabid/225/Article/105039/dr-ruth-pachter.aspx>Dr. Ruth Pachter</a> at the AFRL.
It was a legacy code that needed upgrading and porting to an immersive visualization environment.
Later, we also added haptics and voice commands to the applicaton.
