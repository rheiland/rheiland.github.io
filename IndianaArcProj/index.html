<p>
The outline of this project is as follows:
<ol>
<li>Introduce students to a particular work of art, the
Indiana Arc sculpture (by <a href="http://www.charlesperry.com">Charles Perry</a>), located on the IU-Bloomington campus.
  <ul>
  <li>Field trip to the campus.
  <li>Let them observe it, sketch it (don't allow photos?), make written notes.
  <li>Let them briefly visit the adjoining IU Art Museum (there's a reason).
  <li>Brief visit to IU's Data Center (home to supercomputers, etc)
  </ul>
<li>Take a brief online ("before") survey about that experience.
<li>Classroom: Share their thoughts - partly from the survey.
  <ul>
  <li>Did they like the sculpture?  Why/why not?
  <li>Begin the discussion on possible ways to contruct it.
  <li>Manipulatives.
  </ul>
<li>Classroom: Make connections to algebra and geometry
<li>Classroom: Modeling software (help install on their laptops)
<li>Classroom: Construct a 3D model of the sculpture on the computer - visualize.
<li>Classroom: Analyze their model.
<li>Classroom: Metaphors for the sculpture?
<li>Take a brief online ("after") survey about the overall experience.
<li>Present results at the SIAM conference Feb 28.
</ol>
