<h2>ParallelBFS issue</h2>
10/5/09: We take a look at an issue posted on the VTK-dev list on 10/1/09, asking why the
<a
href=http://public.kitware.com/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/Examples/Infovis/Cxx/ParallelBFS.cxx?view=log>ParallelBFS</a>
 was commented out in the Examples/Infovis/Cxx/CMakeLists.txt.  After taking a look, I
concur that the example could indeed be built, assuming VTK_USE_PARALLEL_BGL is set, and
therefore I committed the change.  Moreover, the user indicated a seg fault when he attempted to
build/run the example.  Not knowing exactly what his environment was (other than LAM MPI), I'll
simply state that the example seems to work for me.<br>
Addendum: it seems the user committed a fix
that perhaps got around the seg fault.
<p>
As always, comments welcome.

<p>
My environment is (and I simply do mpirun on my laptop, no remote cluster):
<pre>
<li>OSX 10.5.8
<li>cmake version 2.6-patch 4
<li>VTK from CVS
<li>Boost 1.40 (which includes PBGL)
<li>Open MPI 1.3.3

<p>
Running the original code (100K verts, 10K edges) serially:

<hr>
Let's decrease the # verts (=100) and edges (=10) so we can see something:<br>
Comment: it would seem that the 'SetNumberOfEdges' has no effect, probably due to the
'StartWithTreeOn' (but I haven't looked into it).

Can we run it with 2 nodes?: mpirun -np 2 ParallelBFS<br>
Yes, but a couple of comments:
<li>The initial rendering seems to have "shadow" verts, or somesuch.  We eliminate them by
doing a selection and resize to refresh the rendering.
<li>The random graph is reproducible on each run (implying a constant seed for the randomness)
