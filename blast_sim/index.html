<h1>Blast Simulation</h1>
While working at NCSA, we had a variety of projects related to a contract with the
DoD HPC Modernization program. One project involved the visualization of a bomb blast
simulation and its resulting damage to a nearby building. The simulation was run
at CEWES (now <a href=http://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/>ERDC</a>). 
Eventually, we turned this into
an immersive visualization demo.
