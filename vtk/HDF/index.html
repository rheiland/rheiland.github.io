<h1>HDF 3D Grid Viewer</h1></CENTER>
This tool uses a Java Swing GUI together with Java-wrapped VTK libraries 
to provide visualization of (local) HDF file dataset(s) containing 
3D structured grids with scalar data.<br>
(Here's a <a href="CAPS.html">snapshot</a> of the tool)

<! ---------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>
Currently, only the SGI n32 (mips-4) Java-wrapped VTK libraries are provided.
Check to see that you have a Java VM (and that it's version ?? or later).
<pre>
% java -version
java version "3.1.1 (Sun 1.1.6)"
</pre>

<p>
(??)Verify your JAVA_HOME env var is set -- or set it, e.g.:
<pre>
% setenv JAVA_HOME /usr/java
</pre>

<p>
You will need a program called 'hdf-xml' (that parses the HDF file).
Either copy it from the following directory into a directory found in your
PATH, or append to your PATH this directory where it's located:
<pre>
/afs/ncsa/user/heiland/HDF
</pre>

<p>
Point your LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH (and/or LD_LIBRARY_PATH?) to the shared libraries:
<pre>
% setenv LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH /afs/ncsa/user/heiland/Java/vtk2.3:/afs/ncsa/packages/vtk/vtk2.3/IRIXn32_6.4/lib
% setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /afs/ncsa/user/heiland/Java/vtk2.3:/afs/ncsa/packages/vtk/vtk2.3/IRIXn32_6.4/lib

(maybe also)
% setenv SGI_ABI -n32
</pre>

<p>
Point your Java CLASSPATH to the tool's classes, the VTK classes, the 
Swing jar, etc.
<pre>
% setenv CLASSPATH /usr/java/lib/classes.zip:/afs/ncsa/user/heiland/Java/HDFVis:/afs/ncsa/user/heiland/Java/classes:/afs/ncsa/user/heiland/Java/swing-1.1.1beta2/swingall.jar
</pre>

<! ---------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
To run (this can also be run remotely and displayed on your SGI wkst):
<pre>
% java GV mydata.hdf  (where "mydata.hdf" is a valid HDF4 data file).

e.g.,
% java GV /afs/ncsa/user/heiland/HDF/storm.hdf
</pre>

<p>
If your setup was successful, the tool will popup a window with a GUI on
the left side and a 3D viewing area on the right.  Grab a corner of the
window and increase its size to have the viewing area fill the 
righthand side.  If the first dataset (SDS) of the specified HDF file is a
3D structured grid then you'll see a bounding box of the domain.
<p>
Select the <b>Browse</b> button and find/select the HDF file that you
specified on startup.  This will parse the HDF file and fill the tree
widget.  (Depending on the size of the HDF file and whether or not ranges
are specified, this may take a few seconds to complete).  
Once the file is finished being parsed, you'll see a "root" folder with a
"handle" next to it.  Clicking on a "handle" will open/close that folder (as
will double-clicking on the folder itself).
To select a (3D, scalar) dataset for viewing, simply click on its name 
in the tree.
Opening the dataset folder will reveal the Type, Dimension, and Range of
the data.  Selecting a dataset will also cause that dataset's range 
to be applied to the Isosurface widget and the Colormap.

<p>
The remaining widgets are:
<ul>
<li>XYZ Scale  - to scale the grid (floating point values)
<li>XYZ Stride - to subsample the grid (integer values)
<li>Isosurface - only one is currently allowed
<li>Slice - orthogonal slicing planes (use the combo box next to the Slice 
slider to select which plane to move)
<li>Colormap - the data value range that get mapped into the colormap
</ul>

<p>
For interactive viewing, with the mouse cursor in the viewing area, holding
down the:<br>
<li> left button - rotation
<li> middle button - translation
<li> right button - (vertical motion) zooming
<li> "w"/"s" - wireframe/solid
