#period 1
I appreciated the presentation powerpoint because I'm a visual learner
A little bit of class participation would have been really nice too
the info about memory was very interesting. I wish we would have had time to hear more. The cockroach experiment was gross but very intersting.
a lot of things were talked about that I have no idea about. They seemed very complex and would be difficult for us to understand in one class period
hearing about what synapses have to do with memory
include basic overview @ the beginning
he made the presentation interesting and didn't try to be too in depth about any one thing
there was not a lot of interaction with the audience
the visuals - photos and graphs - were the most helpful in understanding the concepts. Also, the side stories you told were interesting.
some slides were too dense and not explained thoroughly
the memory hypothesis
I didn't understand the point from the Powerpoint
He gave good visual aids. Had good volume, speaking rate. It was a very good presentation.
it was a little dry. it's just not my cup of tea.
all of the visuals were really good
I didn't really understand the computer language part
neuroscience
none
the small info about the cockroach neurons
IU [Indiana University]. Everything else in the presentation.
Grasping an understanding of neuroscience. I really was interested in the neuron mapping of the brain.
analysis
Had some interesting points like all about the neurons and the brain
sometimes got off track and talked about random stuff
connectome and neurons interacting
mathematical equations
the personal stories
the presentaton/powerpoint was a bit dry
the simplification of complex topics
lack of time
I really liked the topic and listening about neuroscience.  I learned a lot.
I didn't understand all of the concepts and it bothered me, but I'm not upset that he talked about them.
I liked the visuals. They helped with the explanations.
It was hard for me to understand because I don't know anything about computer programming or neuroscience.
I liked the bit on neuroscience and I liked his sense of humor throughout the presentation.
I didn't feel like he clarified some topics enough. He was a little all over the place when he was talking.
the pictures
the lack of astrophysics
I liked the pictures and the concept is very interesting.
I would like to know the practicality of the [cockroach?] experiment. Could it lead to breakthroughs in medicine?
the part about making the bug leg dance
nothing
I liked the concepts and ideas given
a little bit dull
I liked all the pictures and how well the presenter presented his information
I felt some of the material was a bit over my head; meaning it was a little complicated.
I liked the section talking about the neurons
Don't say you're nervous. You did fine.
[blank]
[blank]
there was a lot of info
slides were kinda boring and no hands on stuff.
the fact that now I know I can order a bug in the mail and snip off its legs for science
the whole presentation was rather dry
learning about Python
cockroach leg made me a little queasy
the visual images shown to us
it was awkward at times, not enough explanation
that you really described the topic in depth and went over every little thing
That it was long, but I'm not really into the topic so that is probably why it seemed like forever. TOO MUCH INFO!
#
#
#period 2
the cockroach leg thing
it was all good
pictures in every slide made it easier to understand the concept. And how Mr. Heiland explained some of the concept. It was easy to understand.
But when Calculus was involved in some concept, I did not understand.
I really liked it all! It's really interesting. the pictures helped me understand it more because neuroscience is hard to grasp w/o visualizing it :P
nothing
the experiment with the cockroach
it was good
experiments being done right now.
I didn't think it had much to do with what we were doing in school.
enjoyed seeing [brain??] and learning about brain & neurons.
[blank]
[blank]
[blank]
the presentation was interesting and relevant
[blank]
the info about programming and how it is used to help with science
confusing sometimes
the powerpoint was very informative. I really liked all of the info.
the powerpoint was a little bland to look at.
that the cockroach leg will keep beat with the music
it was a very good presentation, very interesting.
how much info I got out of it. Equations.
[blank]
programming info
[blank]
very informative, I liked it a lot.
didn't have enough time.
the ability he has to work with the brain. Had no idea of all the neurons.
Some of the words were hard to follow without prior knowledge.
#
#
#period 5
i thought it was interesting
it may have been a bit too advanced
good job
lots of white & words; quiet voice; needs a few more picts/demonstrations
the cool pictures
it seemed random to have computer language things in there
when you talked about how memories work in the brain
the whole thing was interesting, nothing was bad
very informative; made me think about stuff with physics, chemistry, biology that I didn't think about before
a little confusing, high level stuff!
the cockroach leg experiment
trying to understand the neuron
the presentation was very well done and it introduced me to a topic I knew very little about
the topic wasn't something I was very interested in
very informative
a little technical <??>
the science of it, neuroscience sounds really interesting.  I like how you connected it to things we understand like circuitry electronics
it was very interesting and not too complex to understand
there was still a lot of details that were hard to understand
the transfer entropy diagram, I thought it was interesting. Seeing Python used for something more than scripting.
not having more time.
I thought the Python program was very interesting in how it functioned and worked.  The spiker box was pretty interesting too.
I didn't enjoy the Phet Colorado page because I didn't see how it connected completely.
the brain is such a fascinating subject!
it was a bit over my head with Python
very interesting
seemed stretched to connect to circuitry/electronics
lots of information provided
how does it relate to our H.S. physics class; need background info
I enjoyed all of the presentation.
nothing
the idea that the entire presentation was about.  Neurons are interesting.
it dragged on a little too long.
vision slide - two faces or a vase?  cockroach leg - I want to watch the youtube video
information is over my head
[student drew 2 faces/vase pictures]
it was a little hard to understand
learning about the complexity of neurons and our brains
the way the information was delivered was a bit dull & difficult to understand
learned a lot about nerves (??) myself; the quote; cockroach
a lot of info in short time, hard to understand sometimes
it was very interesting
everything was interesting
interesting subject matter & points
slides weren't too visually interesting, e.g. black text on white background
I was very interested in the topic and learned very much.  I feel like I better understand what is necessary to go into this field.
wish there was more time.
overviews of neuroscience concepts, they were interesting; cockroach was good too
mathematical models, very complex and difficult to understand
#
#
#period 6
it was really different
nothing
the computer programming
the cockroach... gross
very informative
a bit overwhelming
I liked how the presentation described, in simple terms, how mathematical models can represent neural activity
I least liked that it was all on a Powerpoint! I would have been really interested to SEE something.
I liked the material and some applications like the cockroach leg thing.
I didn't like how confusing the material was. Maybe a demonstration would not only help explain the material, but also make it more interesting.
Lots of in-depth info, good explanations.
Animal testing!
Learning how brains work.
Wish we had talked about how the spiking affects psychology. [In Search of Memory, Eric Kandel!!]
The giant squid thing - that was cool.
Didn't understand 90% of what he said.
Enjoyed learning about neurons in the human brain. Especially how neurons affect human action and thought.
Some of the equations were very confusing to understand.
Cockroach leg dancing to the music.
Nothing, the presentation was very good.
Some of the info was interesting.
It was kind of boring and kind of confusing.
How it was straightforward
[blank]
I like the thing about the cockroach leg, that was cool. 
Nothing really, it was all interesting
The cool facts given.
The lecture - try to make it more interactive.
Showed history of neuron modeling.
The lengthy explanation of formulas.
I liked all of the pictures and examples.
I didn't understand all of it. I wasn't sure what some things meant.
The Hodgkin-Huxley model about the gian squid, also the cockroach leg information
The Izhikevich model - I had trouble understanding.
It was very factual and had a lot of information. I could tell he really knew all his info and it was interesting to learn about something so different from what I am exposed to in my life.
The lack of interaction. It was hard to stay engaged by just listening to info.
The slides on Python.
Some of the slides were hard to comprehend.
It was really neat to hear about what we're doing in a different way.
The equations and computer programming and connection between slides was sometimes confusing.
Talking about slicing the mouse brain and keeping it alive. Cockroach's dancing.
Describing how to use Python.
The presentation was very factual and intriquing.
It was an interesting topic, but I wasn't really sure of the complete relevance to what we're learning about currently.
Mr. Heiland really understood his topic and was very knowledgeable about it.
The presentation was kind of hard to understand.
Presentation was concise and well explained.
Limited class time.
Very Informative, intelligent, and educational.
Not quite the exact content for high school students, pretty confusing/complicated.
