<h1>Outreach and the Open Systems Lab</h1>
Extracted from "Inside PTI" newsletter, March 26, 2010
<p>
The Open Sytems Lab (OSL), a group within the
Digital Science Center (DSC), has had a busy
outreach-related
month, participating in a science
education event for kids and presenting a scholarly
paper on the topic of science and technology
outreach. Read on for more about Randy Heiland's
volunteer work at this year's Indiana State
Science Olympiad.

OSL Research Scientist, Randy Heiland shared his love of science and
technology with groups of enthusiastic young scientists when he served as a
volunteer instructor for the International School of Columbus (ISC) at the ISSO,
held Saturday, March 20 in Bloomington. Randy assisted with a new statewide
trial event, called "Game On," in which middle and highschool
students who
placed first or second in their regional contests competed against each other
using open source software called <a href=https://scratch.mit.edu/>Scratch</a>, to create a computer game on a
given theme. Scratch is a graphical environment that teaches object-oriented
programming and even concurrent
computing with message-passing.
Randy's ISC team (one boy and
one girl) received a 5th place
medal in the event.

Aside from
Randy's lifelong interest in
educating young people, he had
some additional incentive for
participating in the event.
"For me, there was a
personal/family interest - our 13
year old son participated in various events for his middle school - not
the 'Game On' event that I helped teach, but others - the
most significant of which
was the 'Wright Stuff' - building/flying your own rubberband
powered model
airplane to see who had the longest flying time. It was also encouraging to see so
many young women participating in the Olympiad something
that I'm sure our 9 year
old daughter noticed," Randy told Inside.
<p>
Randy also credited other IU and IUPUI volunteers, such as Andy Harris, a senior
lecturer in the Department of Computer and Information Science at IUPUI, for
directing the "Game On" event, and to Tina Gilliland for directing the entire State
Olympiad.
<p>
Bloomington North and South both had great turnouts in the Olympiad as well.
Good job everyone!
